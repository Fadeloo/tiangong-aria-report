# 11 Delivery Guide

Capture the end-to-end handoff plan to ensure consistent delivery across engagements. Include packaging details, transmission steps, and post-delivery commitments.

## Context

- Final materials (`materials/output/final/`)
- Metadata from `materials/output/final/metadata.json`
- Client preferences captured in `docs/01-project-overview.md`
- Final deliverable record (`docs/09-final-deliverable.md`)
- Organizational policies or SLAs relevant to delivery

## Available Tools

- Compression utilities (`zip`, `tar`) for packaging assets
- Secure transfer channels (SFTP, client portals, shared drives)
- Communication templates for delivery emails or tickets
- Versioning or release tagging tools if repositories are involved

## Process

1. List all files included in the delivery package, noting format and location. Reference checksum or hash values if required.
2. Document the distribution channel (e.g., secure upload link, email attachment) and provide step-by-step instructions for execution.
3. Record credentials or access considerations (share expiration, password delivery method) with appropriate security practices.
4. Outline confirmation procedures: how to verify the client received the package, expected acknowledgment window, and escalation path.
5. Specify post-delivery tasks such as follow-up meetings, support windows, or archival requirements.

## Output Expectations

- Reproducible delivery playbook that any team member can follow.
- Clear accountability for who performs the handoff and monitors confirmation.
- Documented contingency plans for delivery failures or requested revisions.
